# Sea Rot
Sea Rot is disease which was plaguing the town of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]]. 
The Sea Rot caused sailors who left the harbor to fall sick out at sea and never return. A wizard who was hiding on [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Widow's Rook\|Widow's Rook]] was responsible for this disease/curse and was hoarding the [[Things and Objects/Spice\|Spice]] shipments.

After some guidance from a traveling group of [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Gnome\|gnomes]] in [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Driftwood Forest\|Driftwood Forest]], [[Player Characters/Faefi\|Faefi]], [[Player Characters/Picasso\|Picasso]], [[Player Characters/Ira\|Ira]], [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]], and [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] cleansed the town of the aliment.
