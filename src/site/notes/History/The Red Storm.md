# The Red Storm
[[History/The Red Storm\|The Red Storm]] is the period of time in [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]] which followed [[History/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]]. This period is characterized by the fiery eruptions of many of the continent's volcanoes, notably, [[World/Korlornium/Mount Redshield\|Mount Redshield]]. During this period the Earth was unstable and often deep chasms opened up in the ground from the tectonic activity. Those who explored these chasms seldom returned, and those who did spoke tales of fantastical journeys. Who is to say what is really at the bottom of these chasms as the exact locations of them have been lost over time.

Ash choked the skies for years during this period of time causing agriculture to fail and the collapse of many civilizations.
