[[Gods/Major Powers/Parsus\|Parsus]], god of rain and snow, is revered as the bringer of life and renewal. Farmers across [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], especially those within the [[Pugent Delta\|Pugent Delta]], offer prayers and sacrifices to Parsus, seeking his favor for abundant harvests and fertile lands.

In the arid expanse of [[World/Korlornium/Siroth/Siroth\|Siroth]], where the parched earth thirsts for his blessing, faith in Parsus is particularly strong. His rains carve rivers through the desert, filling long-dry basins, and his snowfall feeds the highland springs, ensuring survival in the harsh climate. Many nomadic tribes of Siroth view him as a wanderer, moving with the shifting sands, bestowing water where it is needed most.

Parsus is often depicted as a cloaked figure of mist and shadow, with a crown of storm clouds, his presence heralded by the distant rumble of thunder or the whisper of falling snow. His followers, including farmers, sailors, and those who rely on the mercy of the elements, believe that Parsus does not answer to mortalsâ€”he gives and withholds as he sees fit, his will as unpredictable as the weather itself.

Legends speak of a time when Parsus wept for the world, his sorrow birthing the great rivers and lakes, while his wrath is said to manifest in torrential storms and floods that wash away the impure. Some say that when Parsus and [[Gods/Major Powers/Forgas\|Forgas]] clash, the skies ignite with lightning and fire, and the land trembles beneath their fury.
