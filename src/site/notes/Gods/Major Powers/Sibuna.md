"In the end we cannot out run the hunter"

God of death. One of the original three gods. She is twin sisters to the goddess of life [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]], and elder sister to the goddess of night [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]]. They all have a close relationship with each other as one cannot exist without the other. 

Sibuna appears as a wolf hunting souls to shepherd them into the afterlife, and throughout [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]] a symbol of the wolf is used to represent Sibuna and her followers.
