# Sora
[[Gods/Major Powers/Sora\|Sora]] reigns as the celestial goddess of the vast sky, her domain stretching from the heights of the heavens to the gentle breezes that caress the earth below. In [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], [[Gods/Major Powers/Sora\|Sora]] is more than just the sky; she is the breath of the wind, the expanse of the clouds, and the light that touches the land in every sunrise and sunset. She embodies freedom, fluidity, and the ever-changing nature of the heavens themselves. Her followers believe that Sora is the weaver of weather and the keeper of storms, with her moods reflected in the shifting skies.

One of her most devoted worshippers is the mysterious and regal [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]], a species that holds a unique connection to both the sky and the divine. The [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]], with their feathered forms and avian grace, revere Sora as the mother of their people, believing that she granted them the gift of flight and the wisdom of the heavens. Together with [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]], a god of the storm and thunder, Sora is central to their beliefs. To the [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]], [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] represents the power and ferocity of the sky’s fury, while Sora embodies its nurturing and serene aspects.

The [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]]’s ancient temples to [[Gods/Major Powers/Sora\|Sora]] are often built in high places—mountaintops, cliffs, or towering spires, where the wind carries the whispers of their goddess. Rituals are conducted at dawn and dusk, when the skies are at their most vibrant, offering praise to Sora for her guidance and the peace she brings to the skies. It is said that those who are attuned to the will of Sora can hear the song of the winds and interpret the patterns in the clouds, foretelling events or discovering hidden truths.

But the relationship between Sora and [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] is not merely one of harmony. The two gods, while revered together, also represent contrasting aspects of the sky, [[Gods/Major Powers/Sora\|Sora]], and the land, [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]].
