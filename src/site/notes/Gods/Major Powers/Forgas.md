[[Gods/Major Powers/Forgas\|Forgas]], god of fire and forge, is the divine patron of blacksmiths, artisans, and all who shape metal and stone. Worshiped across [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], his presence is strongest in communities near [[World/Mount Redshield\|Mount Redshield]], the towering volcano where he is said to slumber, his fiery breath fueling the heart of the mountain.

Depicted as a colossal iron ram, smoldering with embers beneath his metallic hide, Forgas is believed to breathe flame into [[Planes/The Mundane World\|The Mundane World]], forging the cycle of destruction and renewal. His followers—blacksmiths, warriors, and even some druids—see his flame not as mere destruction, but as transformation, a force that tempers and refines all things.

Many blacksmiths offer the first strike of their hammer to Forgas, whispering prayers for strength and inspiration in their craft. In times of war, warriors etch his sigil onto their blades, believing his fire will make their steel unbreakable. Even among farmers and druids, his flame is seen as a catalyst for regrowth, burning away the old to make way for the new.

Legends tell that when the balance of the world is disturbed, the fire beneath [[World/Mount Redshield\|Mount Redshield]] stirs, and Forgas awakens, his molten fury reshaping the land. Some fear this as a sign of impending doom, while others believe it heralds a necessary cleansing before renewal.

Though a being of immense power, Forgas is not cruel nor merciful—he is simply the fire that shapes all things, forging both weapons and civilizations in his wake.
