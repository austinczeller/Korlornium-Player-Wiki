# Alune
[[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] is the goddess of the night, a young and mischievous deity whose domain extends over shadows, illusions, and secrets. She is the younger sister of [[Gods/Major Powers/Sibuna\|Sibuna]], the goddess of death, and [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]], the goddess of life and the sun. Unlike her sisters, who govern the natural cycles of existence, [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] thrives in the spaces between—where the veil of night blurs truth and deception.

Her followers often embrace trickery, subterfuge, and guile, seeing deception as both an art and a means of survival. While many fear her influence, others revere her as a protector of outcasts and wanderers, granting safe passage under the cover of darkness. Myths tell of [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] weaving the first shadows, hiding secrets in the stars, and whispering forbidden truths to those who listen.

Her temples are rare, often disguised as mundane structures or hidden beneath the surface world, known only to those who seek them. Though she is unpredictable and playful, her divine mischief always serves a purpose—whether for good or ill is often left to fate.
