Commonly revered as the goddess of nature, Elaris is, in truth, the goddess of growth and renewal. Unlike other deities who govern singular aspects of existence, her power is a delicate interplay of multiple divine forces—drawing from [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] (earth & stone), [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]] (sun & life), [[Gods/Major Powers/Parsus\|Parsus]] (seasons & time), [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]] (water & tides), and [[Gods/Major Powers/Sibuna\|Sibuna]] (death & decay).

Rather than directly shaping the natural world, Elaris establishes the rules of life, ensuring that mortal creatures—flora, fauna, and even sentient races—exist within an ever-sustaining cycle.
