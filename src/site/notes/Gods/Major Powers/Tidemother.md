# Tidemother
[[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]], goddess of tides and waves, holds dominion over the shifting seas and the ever-changing currents. Many sailors pray to her for safe passage, offering trinkets, songs, and whispered oaths before setting sail. She is one of the most widely worshiped deities in [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], especially among seafarers who must navigate the treacherous waters of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/The Scar\|The Scar]], where unpredictable tides and unseen dangers lurk beneath the waves.

She shares a strong kinship with [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]], goddess of the night, as both are mischievous forces who delight in toying with mortal fates. While [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] weaves deception in shadow, [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]] plays her games upon the sea, shifting currents and stirring storms at a whim.

Legends speak of her appearing as a siren, emerging from moonlit waters to lure sailors toward an uncertain fate. Some claim she grants boons to those who amuse her, while others warn that she delights in pulling the arrogant and the unwary into the depths. Despite her unpredictable nature, she is not cruelâ€”only capricious, as wild and untamed as the ocean itself.

Her shrines are found in coastal cities and aboard ships, often adorned with shells, driftwood, and offerings cast into the sea. Those who earn her favor find winds at their back and calm waters ahead, while those who spurn her might never see land again.
