[[Gods/Major Powers/Dithoria (God)\|Dithoria]], god of law, is revered as the unyielding hand of order and the embodiment of absolute justice. He is often depicted as a stoic and imposing young man, clad in shining armor or flowing judicial robes, his expression unwavering in its certainty. Though many worship him as a beacon of structure and civilization, his unyielding nature has led some to view him as arrogant, believing only he has the wisdom to maintain balance in the [[Planes/The Mundane World\|The Mundane World]].

His righteous decree is said to be etched into the very laws that govern society, and his followers—often judges, lawmakers, and rulers—seek to uphold his vision of order, even when it borders on tyranny. Many stories speak of Dithoria clashing with other deities, particularly those who embody chaos, freedom, or deception, as he seeks to impose his rigid ideals upon the world.

The great city of [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Dithoria City/Dithoria City\|Dithoria City]] was built in his honor, its towering spires and immaculate streets designed to reflect the perfect order he desires. According to legend, Dithoria himself saved the people from [[Events/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]], a cataclysmic flood that threatened to wipe out civilization. Whether this was an act of divine intervention or a legend woven by his devoted followers, none can say for certain.

Though Dithoria is often worshiped with reverence, some whisper that his influence has grown too rigid—his will interpreted in ways that suffocate the natural order rather than preserve it. The [[Council of Dithoria\|Council of Dithoria]], a powerful sect devoted to his teachings, is rumored to be meddling in forces beyond their understanding, believing they act in his name.
