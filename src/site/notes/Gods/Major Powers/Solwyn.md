> "Praise Sister Sol, she breathes life."

Is the goddess of life. In [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]] the people believe that life comes from the sun and therefore Solwyn is typically depicted as a radiant entity wielding the power of the sun. 
She is thought to bring life each day. Her younger sister, [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] is thought to bring on the night while her twin sister [[Gods/Major Powers/Sibuna\|Sibuna]] is the goddess of death. Solwyn acts as the responsible one of her sisters and takes on more than she can handle at times. 
Competing powers have been trying to take her role in the world as the life breather or the sun mover (see minor powers god X).  However her power is still strong in both realms.
