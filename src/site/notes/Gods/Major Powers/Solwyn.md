# Solwyn
> "Praise Sister Sol, she breathes life."

In [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], the people believe that life itself is a gift from the sun, and at the heart of this belief is the radiant goddess [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]]. She is often depicted as a luminous entity, her form aglow with the golden light of the sun. Every day, it is said that she breathes life into the world, nurturing all living creatures with warmth and vitality.

Solwyn is one of the three sisters who govern the celestial cycle, each embodying a crucial aspect of existence. Her younger sister [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]], the goddess of the moon, is believed to usher in the night, bringing a time for rest and reflection. Her twin sister [[Gods/Major Powers/Sibuna\|Sibuna]], however, reigns over death, guiding souls to the afterlife with an air of solemnity.

Solwyn is often considered the most responsible of her sisters, carrying the weight of both creation and preservation. She is the source of vitality, the protector of growth, and the embodiment of hope. However, this immense responsibility sometimes causes her to take on more than she can bear, as she strives to maintain balance between her duties and the needs of her siblings. While [[Gods/Major Powers/Alune\|Alune]] and [[Gods/Major Powers/Sibuna\|Sibuna]]'s roles are clear and unyielding, [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]] is often seen as the caretakerâ€”holding the delicate balance of life, growth, and vitality in her hands.

This sense of duty has led to some tension within the pantheon. Many of the other gods and goddesses, including those who wield powers of nature, fertility, and the seasons, argue that [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]] bears too much responsibility. Some even question her ability to fulfill her role as the "life-breather" or the "sun-mover," as competing powers within the pantheon challenge her authority. These struggles among the gods have created an undercurrent of discord, with some divine figures seeking to take her place or diminish her influence.

Despite this, [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]] remains a beacon of hope and warmth for the people of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]]. Her followers often pray to her for fertility, growth, and the prosperity of their crops and communities. Her influence is felt most strongly in the spring and summer, when the sun shines brightly and life flourishes. Yet, the whispers of her ever-increasing burdens persist, leaving many to wonder: how long can one goddess bear the weight of life itself?
