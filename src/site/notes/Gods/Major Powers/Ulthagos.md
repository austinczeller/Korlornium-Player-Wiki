> "As the earth quakes so does Ulthagos" 


God of the land and earth. 
He appears as an strong stone giant as it is thought he built the land and minerals of the world. He is an old god, often reclusive, and does not get along with the [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]].
Most of Ulthagos' followers were lost during the events of the [[Events/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]]. Faithful were said to be given great power to shape earth and stone.
