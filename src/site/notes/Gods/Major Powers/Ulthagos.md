> "As the earth quakes so does [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]]" 

[[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]], the ancient and mighty god of the land, is a figure of immense power and silent wisdom. Often depicted as a towering stone giant, his form is said to embody the very essence of the earth itself—massive and unyielding, with skin like jagged rock and eyes that glow with the deep warmth of molten stone. [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]], with the help of [[Gods/Major Powers/Forgas\|Forgas]], is believed to have forged the land and minerals of [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], shaping mountains, valleys, and caverns with his colossal hands, breathing life into the very ground beneath his people’s feet.

[[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] is a god of creation, but his nature is one of solitude and reflection. He is an old god, long before the rise of many of the younger deities in the pantheon, and his presence is felt more in the silence of the earth than in the noisy lives of mortals. His followers believe that [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] is the foundation upon which the world stands, a force of nature whose strength lies in patience and endurance.

Though a revered figure among many, [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] is not one for grand displays or social interactions, and as such, he is often seen as distant and reclusive. He has little love for the [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]], the goddess of the seas, and the two are often at odds, representing the eternal clash between the stability of the land and the ever-changing, unpredictable nature of the oceans. This animosity between the two gods has caused friction, particularly in the coastal regions, where the forces of the sea often encroach upon the lands that [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] crafted. The [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]], with her fluid and shifting domain, is said to challenge [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]]’ rigid, unmoving essence, creating an eternal rivalry that leaves their followers torn between the forces of water and stone.

The faith of [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] suffered a tragic blow during [[Events/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]], a cataclysmic event in which the oceans swelled and drowned vast stretches of land, destroying much of the god’s worshippers and temples. Entire cities built in [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]]’ name were swept away in a tidal surge so powerful that it was said to have been sent by the [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]] herself in response to the land’s dominance. In the aftermath, most of [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]]' faithful were lost, and the once-thriving temples to the god of the earth now lie in ruins, buried beneath the waves or buried in the earth itself.

Those who are faithful to [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] have noted they have been able to shape and control stone. Although now, this gift is rare to be found in the current climate of [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]]. These devoted followers, often known as [[Earthshapers\|Earthshapers]], possess the strength to move mountains, create valleys, and form structures from solid rock with a mere thought. Their connection to [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] is a deep one, forged in the ancient and enduring power of the land. Some [[Earthshapers\|Earthshapers]] have used their powers to rebuild the broken world after [[Events/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]], while others have withdrawn from society, guarding sacred lands and ancient stone shrines that honor their god’s name.

[[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]]’ followers now gather in secret, worshipping in the hidden caverns, stone temples, and mountain strongholds that still stand in his name. They believe that one day, their god will rise again from the earth’s depths to reclaim his lost lands and reshape the world in his image—sturdy, unmovable, and eternal.
