## Description

A newer, small port town located on the [[Duskwind River\|Duskwind River]] in the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Pugent Delta\|Pugent Delta]] region of [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Caldrith\|Caldrith]] in [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]]. It is fairly transient as many people and stopping and going for shipments of cargo and resupply. The town was notably plagued with the curse of [[History/Sea Rot\|Sea Rot]] which halted export and import of goods to the harbor. A travelling band of adventurers recently quelled the curse and goods have now begun to flow, most notable export is the trade of [[Things and Objects/Spice\|Spice]].

The vibe is a rainy port town, fairly industrial, has a shady side.
