# Water Vessels for Fools
Written by: [[Reese Stompletooth\|Reese Stompletooth]]

# Introduction
Ahoy, aspiring skippers! If this tome has fallen into your grubby hands, you’re likely dreaming of owning your very own floating deathtrap—er, vessel! Allow me, the illustrious Reese Stompletooth, to steer you through the oh-so-**thrilling** rollercoaster of keeping your ship from sinking, burning, or mutinying. Buckle your lifejackets… or don’t. Glory awaits!

# Chapter 1: A Vessel's Anatomy
Here’s your chance to sound smart when you bellow, “Bring me that stanchion!” while pointing at… something. On our grand floating stage, we’ve got:

- **The Pointy End** (also known as the **Bow**) – It’s the front bit that hits waves. Use it for pointing dramatically or causing first impressions.
    
- **The Squishy End** (a.k.a. the **Stern**) – Don’t stand here unless you fancy kissing the ocean floor.
    
- **That Flat Thing You Walk On** (the **Deck**) – Ideal for epic swordfights, unsteady dancing, or falling drunkenly overboard.
    
- **The Tall Sky Pole** (or **Mast**) – Because no Good Captain is complete without shouting from dizzying heights.
    
- **The Fancy Sail Blanket** – Catch the wind, sail us onward, and, hopefully, stop the whole thing from capsizing.
    

Point at these and you’ll sound like you know a little something about floating.

# Chapter 2: Equipment Aboard
#### **Artillery: The Boomboom**

If talking doesn’t work, these will. Some vessels carry at least one form of ship-shattering armament. Below are the staples and personal favorites:

- **Deck Cannons**  
     Fire these bad boys from the main deck. Reload time? Ages. But worth it for that sweet, sweet crunching of enemy hull.
        - Damage: 6d10 bludgeoning
        
    - Reload: 3 actions (or 1 round with help from Powder Monkeys)
        
    - Range: 600 ft
        
- **Ballista**  
    For when you wanna shoot but don’t wanna commit. Mounted near the railings. Good for dealing with annoying pirates clambering aboard.
        - Damage: 3d8 piercing
        
    - Reload: 1 action
        
    - Range: 200 ft
        
- **Harpoon Launchers**  
    Great for snagging sea monsters _and_ rude enemies trying to leave. Also handy for dragging smaller vessels closer for a lil’ chat.
        - Damage: 4d6 piercing + grappling effect
        
    - Reload: 1 action
        
    - Range: 150 ft rope (double if you’re feeling frisky)
        
- **Fire Pitch Cauldrons**  
    Drop boiling hell on anyone beneath. Used in very polite wars for a dramatic flair.
        - Damage: 5d8 fire in a 10-ft radius
        
    - Reload: Takes one minute (seriously, don’t spill this stuff)
        
- **Chain Shot**  
    Loaded into cannons, this tangled steel nightmare is meant to ruin sails and break masts. A real crowd-unpleaser.
        - Special: Instead of damage, halves enemy ship’s speed on hit and disables sails for 1d4 rounds.

#### **Repair Tools: Keeping the Lady Together**

Your ship _will_ get holes. When that happens, patch it up like your life depends on it (because it does).

- **Carpenter’s Chest**  
    Filled with nails, wood planks, sawdust, three hammers, one of which is always sticky. Essential for on-the-fly hull repairs.
    
- **Pitch Barrels**  
    Tar and pitch keep the seams sealed. Or make a great last-minute weapon. Just don’t trip.
    
- **Tinkerer's Kit**  
    A strange collection of screws, wires, small hammers, and "mystery metal"—used for upgrading any of the ship's parts or artillery. Comes with one gnome manual (unreadable).

#### **Navigation & Tools of the Trade**

You can’t sail into the wind with just a vibe. You need tools, maps, and *probably* someone who can read.

- **Nautical Charts**  
    Maps of coastlines, currents, shipping lanes, and probably at least one suspicious "Here be death" drawing. Required by the quartermaster to _Chart a Course_.
    
- **Captain’s Spyglass**  
    For seeing faraway things, or pretending to. May be used to look menacing. +1 to intimidation while peering dramatically.
    
- **Compass of the Sea Hag’s Grin**  
    Points not just north, but toward whatever the DM finds most terrifying. Cursed? Probably. Fun? Definitely.
    
- **Sextant**  
    For the one person who understands stars and likes showing off.
    
- **The Wheel**  
    Known colloquially as "the spinny thing". Used by the pilot to steer the ship. If it’s missing, you’re probably doomed.


# Chapter 3: Commanding Officers
The following positions will be listed: These positions can be changed at any time during a ships voyage. However, individuals holding positions such as the Captain and First Mate should be in good standing with the ship's crew and maintain a high crew morale or risk a mutiny. While at sea, commanding officers receive special abilities to assist in sailing, combat, and operations of the vessel.

**Captain.** The captain issues orders. The best captains have high Intelligence and Charisma scores, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and the Intimidation and Persuasion skills. The captain is typically makes the decisions about the vessel's high level operations after consultation with the rest of the commanding officers.
	*Push the crew*. The captain twice a day can choose to push the crew. Upon a successful persuasion or intimidation check the crew can preform a task in half the amount of time regularly required. In combat crew members can take two actions in one round of initiative. However, if the crew is pushed too hard the crew may lose morale.

**First Mate**. This specialist keeps the crew’s morale up by providing close supervision, encouragement, and discipline. A first mate benefits from a high Charisma score, as well as proficiency with the Intimidation and Persuasion skills. 
	*Raise Morale* The first mate once a day can spend an action attempting to raise the morale of the crew, this can be done by a speech, motivational words, or planning a group activity on board. Upon a successful charisma check the first mate can raise the morale of the crew and assign two inspiration die (1d6) to a the crew. When morale drops is low the crew will cease to function and risk mutiny. 

**Boatswain**. The boatswain (or bosun) provides technical advice to the captain and crew and leads repair and maintenance efforts. A good boatswain has a high Strength score, as well as proficiency with carpenter’s tools and the Athletics skill. A good boatswain is valuable when looking to upgrade a vessel's equipment. A boatswain can do **one** of the following actions a day:
	*Ship Repairs*. Once a day the boatswain can choose to repair the vessel, essentially recovering lost HP during combat. Upon a successful dexterity or athletics check the boat may be healed (5d10) damage.
	*Tinker*. Once a day the boatswain can choose to use either carpenter's tools or tinkerer's tools in order to upgrade the ships artillery, defenses, sails, living quarters, navigation, or other components of the vessel. The player will need to describe what they are trying to accomplish and the DM will decide DC and how long it may take to complete the task.

**Quartermaster**. The quartermaster plots the ship’s course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable quartermaster tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as proficiency with navigator’s tools and the Nature skill. In small vessels the quartermaster may also take on the pilot's role.
	*Chart a course*. Once a day the quartermaster makes a nature, investigation, or perception (at the DM discretion) check in order to chart a safe passage through the waters. The roll will decide how the difficulty in which the pilot will have to steer the vessel.
	*Full speed* Once a day the quartermaster can choose to double the distance for 1 minute (out of combat) or 2 rounds (inside combat).
	
**Pilot**. The pilot is in charge of manually steering the boat. This position typically requires individuals with high dexterity. They will typically be stationed at the helm of the ship during tough waters. 
	*Evasive maneuvers*. Once a day the pilot will have to make a dexterity check to see how well they can evade obstacles. The difficulty of this task will be determined by the result of the quartermaster's *Chart a course* roll. 
	*Set sail*. The pilot is responsible for maneuvering the vessel during combat and turn based play.
	

**Master of Arms**. The master of arms is in charge of a ship's combat strategy. A master gunner typically arms the artillery aboard and has good dexterity or strength. On large vessels the master of arms typically commands the ship's powder monkeys.
	*Fire!* The master of arms is responsible for commanding the ship's artillery within combat. The master of arms will determine target selection and roll damage die.
	*Weapons tinker*. Once a day the master of arms can assist the boatswain with tinkering on weapons only. This gives advantage to the next roll.

**Angler**. The ship’s angler takes care of trapping and/or catching fish or other sea life onboard of the vessel. Good anglers typically benefit from high survival and nature skills. Depending on the operation and equipment of the vessel the angler can manage of several traps or lines in the water.  
	*Gone fishin'*. Once a day the angler can make a fishing roll, upon a success the angler can provide food for the crew or choose to stow the haul to be sold on land.

**Cook**. A ship’s cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew’s morale in top shape, while a poor one drags down the entire crew’s performance. A talented cook has a high Constitution or Survival score, as well as proficiency with brewer’s supplies and cook’s utensils. Assigning a designated chef will help boost morale of the crew.
	*Chef's kiss* Once a day the chef prepares a meal for the crew. Depending on the success of their cooking roll and ingredients used, the meal can uplift morale, restore missing HP, and/or provide temporary HP.
	*Gone fishin'*.
	
# Chapter 4: Crew
Outside of these positions, depending how large your vessel is you will need to crew members to operate the vessel to sail long distances and undergo routine maintenance. 
Crew members are usually assigned the status of:
1. Swabbies: Individuals who assist in the above deck operations during sailing. These people are typically strong or dexterous, and capable of hard work. Typically duties are handling sails and keeping the ship moving.
2.  Cabin crew: Cabin crew typically work below deck assisting the cook, angler, or janitorial services. These crew members are typically good for a ship's morale.  
3. Powder Monkeys: Individuals who will arm a ships artillery during combat. Out of combat these individuals typically handle minor tasks which keep the ship moving and ship maintenance.
Morale is an extremely important consideration to take in to account when deciding to take a crew on a voyage. It is the responsibility of the first mate to ensure crew members are happy and not overworked. Once a day the first mate can do the action *Raise Morale*
# Chapter 5: Sailing
During sailing leadership positions will have to make ability checks related to their posts in order to successfully traverse through the waters (i.e., a ship's captain will be giving orders to the ship's crew thereby requiring a successful CHA check). The difficulty of these tasks will be dependent on the quality and morale of the crew, hazards present in the waters, and the way in which the leaders (players) describe their actions.

# Chapter 6: Combat
Ship to ship combat is always possible especially for travel across [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/The Scar Sea/The Scar\|The Scar]]. In the unfortunate case when this occurs the master of arms takes control of the ship's artillery. On their initiative they can use an action to fire the ship's artillery. The either the pilot, quartermaster, captain or first mate will be in charge of helming the ship and navigating it in the battlefield. The other members of the leadership team can use their action
