# Campaign Log

Session 1- Sea Rot plagued the town of [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]]. The group of [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]], [[Player Characters/Faefi\|Faefi]], [[Player Characters/Ira\|Ira]], [[Player Characters/Picasso\|Picasso]], and [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] were tasked to solving how/who has been afflicting the sailors with this curse by the head of the undercity [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]], after being exposed to a [[History/Sea Rot\|Sea Rot]] body due to [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Unassuming NPC's/Maurice Greentusk\|Maurice]] bringing a body into[[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/The Sunken Sail\|The Sunken Sail]] tavern. [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin]] pointed the group to a group of [[Species/Common Intelligent Species/Gnome\|gnomes]] which have been taken up residence in the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Driftwood Forest\|Driftwood Forest]] as of late. After chugging a couple of pints of [[Goblin Piss\|Goblin Piss]] the gang was off. They decided to first check out [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Sapphire Beach\|Sapphire Beach]] where the body was discovered. They found nothing but an unusually high tide and an unusually sticky ice cream shop ([[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Delights\|Duskwind Delights]]). After some minor trespassing the crew adventured into the forest where they confronted the gnomes. The group ended up murdering one individual and made the rest of the gnomes surrender. After an interrogation the group learned the gnomes were innocent but knew there was an imbalance in the magics of the world, and something was not quite right with the world. The gnomes said they were fleeing to the dwarves in the mountains. But there was great evil coming from [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Widow's Rook\|Widow's Rook]]. After learning this the gang went to find a boat. [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]] agreed to lend them a small vessel and the crew set sail. After passing a series of sailing challenges, despite being under the influence of [[Things and Objects/Spice\|Spice]], the gang made it to [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Widow's Rook\|Widow's Rook]]. Here they confronted a mad wizard, defeating him and taking in the hoard of [[Things and Objects/Spice\|Spice]] and shipments the wizard had stashed.

Session 2- [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] and [[Player Characters/Faefi\|Faefi]] met up with two new members of their new adventuring group, [[Player Characters/Kel\|Kel]] and [[Player Characters/Thorne\|Thorne]] in [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/The Sunken Sail\|The Sunken Sail]]. Here they noticed a few gnomes wander through the door, which was odd. They approached them and befriended the gnome named [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Unassuming NPC's/Melkor Fluffybottom\|Melkor Fluffybottom]]. Melkor told the group about weird sounds coming from the old ruins that have the gnomes spooked as the reside in the forest. He then led the gang to the forest and left them near the ruins where the party had to find their way for rest. They eventually found the ruins and fought a battle against some animated stone statues which seemed to be protecting a sand pit. After figuring that there may be something hidden beneath the sandpit [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] agreed to test it out and submitted to the earth.  As he was engulfed he began to breathe sand and  witnessed a large stone figure in white light. The stone figure touched his face and everything faded to black. The party tried to rescue [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] through pulling on some rope, but he naturally ascended on his own. From there the ground began to quake and revealed a hidden passage buried in the sand.

Session 3- [[Player Characters/Picasso\|Picasso]] and [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] met up with the party as they were resting near the entrance of a underground cavern. There were plenty of symbols of [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]] on banners and crests in the entryway. They were greeted by a playful glowing orb which led them to a larger room where a [[Enemies/Spectator\|Spectator]] awaited. After a brief and sassy conversation battle commenced and the [[Enemies/Spectator\|Spectator]] was defeated. The group noted large snake-like bones on the ground but proceeded into the lit library that the [[Enemies/Spectator\|Spectator]] was guarding. In this room the party met [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Zora Meadowlark\|Zora]] who appeared frightened at first but then creepily smiled revealing a long tongue and teleported out as soon as the party became suspicious of her. The party scoured the library and found some books about [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]], a box of beans, sneezing dust, and a book . As they were searching they began to feel the earth quake and quickly exited the cavern. As they emerged they witnessed a wave of destruction cascading over the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Driftwood Forest\|Driftwood Forest]]. [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] expressed her anger and wants to know who is responsible.

Session 4-  The party left [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Old Duskwind\|Old Duskwind]] and searched the forest for survivors of the deadly quake. Mainly [[Player Characters/Faefi\|Faefi]] ended up finding and freeing [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Unassuming NPC's/Melkor Fluffybottom\|Melkor Fluffybottom]] from underneath his tent. He was grateful and received care back at [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/The Sunken Sail\|The Sunken Sail]]. The party noted many of the townspeople looking at them funny, and were informed there was a town council meeting happening. As the party entered the room they were interrogated with what they were doing in [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Old Duskwind\|Old Duskwind]]. The party divulged that they met some sort of magic wielder [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Zora Meadowlark\|Zora]] who was really creepy and they think she was the reason why the terrible quake happened. The heads of the town ([[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]], [[Notable NPC's/Neutral/Father Elias Vance\|Father Elias Vance]], and [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Shandra Loomens\|Shandra Loomens]]) were relatively unconvinced however and thought it suspicious that they were in that area, especially [[Notable NPC's/Neutral/Father Elias Vance\|Father Elias Vance]] and [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Shandra Loomens\|Shandra Loomens]]. This is when [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Yannis Trask\|Yannis Trask]] piped in proclaiming that he had witnessed a ship leave the harbor this morning. With the party believing that [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Zora Meadowlark\|Zora]] may be on this vessel. [[Notable NPC's/Neutral/Father Elias Vance\|Father Elias Vance]] vouched for them to leave under the supervision of [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Yannis Trask\|Yannis Trask]] to catch the ship. On aboard the [[Things and Objects/The Salty Bitch\|The Salty Bitch]], [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Yannis Trask\|Yannis Trask]]'s ship, they were quickly drugged by the busty barmaid, [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Betula\|Betula]] and imprisoned below deck. After much debate on what to doâ€” [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] turned into a rat to scurry around to gather intel after charming the guards who were watching over them. She found the captain's quarters but did not learn much and other than there were some crewmates gambling. As the party squabbled with each other they were eventually thrown overboard onto an island called [[World/Korlornium/The Scar Sea/Saltmire Cay\|Saltmire Cay]]. They were given 4-6 hours before they were going to be hunted.

Session 5- As the party ran for the hills to set up a place to rest and found a built platform. After some recon they discovered what looked to be a trapped log with some berries in it and encountered a large crocodile. [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] conversed with the crocodile and told him to go to the ladder which the party found for a feast later. The crocodile wanted finish his patrol and get his mate, but didn't seem too friendly. As the sun rose the party battled with a group of pirates which were handily taken care of. They then tried to make it for the boat but encountered another crew of pirates, this one was led by [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Joanos\|Joanos]], [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]]'s former crewmate. [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Joanos\|Joanos]] seemed different and wanted to talk to [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] once he was dead. After nearly perishing, the party defeated the pirates and [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] was pretty chaffed about killing [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Joanos\|Joanos]]. The party found a journal which [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Joanos\|Joanos]] kept and it seems that he was consorting with the likes of [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Zora Meadowlark\|Zora]].

Session 6- The party befriended [[World/Korlornium/The Scar Sea/wok-wok\|wok-wok]]s and ate [[wokberries\|wokberries]] to shrink down enough to squeeze into a magic hole in the tree to rest. They investigated where the ship was located an decided to sneak up on it with the guidance of the wok-woks. They were quickly spotted thanks to a bad sneaking by [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]]. They initiated combat and found [[Yannis Trask \|Yannis Trask ]]was a ghosty boy. [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]] was skeptical of this guy and snuck on board and was hiding in a barrel. He popped out to try to join the party in the fight. After defeating the crew, the party searched the captains quarters. They found a couple of magic items, and a ledger that said where the ship has been and plans for future expeditions. It showed travel from [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Dithoria City/Dithoria City\|Dithoria City]] and [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]], [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Frostcrag Glade\|Frostcrag Glade]], [[Rosesholl\|Rosesholl]] and [[Stormveil\|Stormveil]] (near [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Heaven's Hole/Heaven's Hole\|Heaven's Hole]]).

Session 7- Once they defeated [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Yannis Trask\|Yannis Trask]] and crew they went off to find the [[World/Korlornium/The Scar Sea/wok-wok\|wok-wok]]s and retrieve them to be apart of [[Organizations/The Salty Bitches\|The Salty Bitches]]. [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] also ran off to find [[Notable NPC's/Inactive or Perished/Joanos\|Joanos]]'s body to ask him questions with the new necklace he found which allows him to speak with the dead. [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] kinda botched the questions and really didn't learn a whole lot new other than the fact that he had died during the siege at [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Frostcrag Glade\|Frostcrag Glade]]. Upon return [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]] and [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] had a heated yelling match about the ownership of the [[Things and Objects/The Salty Bitch\|The Salty Bitch]]. [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] stormed off and wasn't much help sailing back to [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]] but the ladies, [[Player Characters/Faefi\|Faefi]], [[Player Characters/Thorne\|Thorne]], and [[Player Characters/Soffalie\|Soffalie]] luckily pulled through and made it back to [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]]. Where they investigated the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Tidemother Temple of Duskwind\|Tidemother Temple of Duskwind]] and were directed towards the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Rusty Hook\|Rusty Hook]] where [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]]'s men had taken [[Notable NPC's/Neutral/Father Elias Vance\|Father Elias Vance]] captive.

Session 8- In [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]] party was reunited with [[Player Characters/Kel\|Kel]] and [[Player Characters/Picasso\|Picasso]]. They talked with [[Organizations/Clasphand's Hammers\|Clasphand's Hammers]] at the fish market who were a traveling band of mercenaries willing to do anything for coin. They told the crew about an opossum problem at the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Delights\|Duskwind Delights]]. The crew also met [[Felix Kled\|Felix Kled]] the woodcarver. Who sold [[Player Characters/Kel\|Kel]] some [[Things and Objects/Stormwood\|Stormwood]], high quality wood. On the was to interrogate [[Notable NPC's/Neutral/Father Elias Vance\|Father Elias Vance]] at the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Rusty Hook\|Rusty Hook]], the party bumped into an opossum holding an ice cream cone in his hand. [[Player Characters/Thorne\|Thorne]] tried to track it down but it seemed to be heading far into the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Fish Market\|Fish Market]]. Once arrived into the [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Rusty Hook\|Rusty Hook]] the crew was met with an empty bar with what seemed to be a riddle of some sorts. [[Player Characters/Picasso\|Picasso]] worked with [[Player Characters/Kel\|Kel]] worked together read the book which [[Player Characters/Kel\|Kel]] had received from the library under [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Old Duskwind\|Old Duskwind]] and to solve the riddle. They ended up learning a bit about the gods as they were the key to opening the door to the real [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Rusty Hook\|Rusty Hook]]. Upon arrival they met the barkeep who told them [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]] will be here soon and Elias was downstairs. She agreed to let the party talk to him and the party learned information that made him seem innocent. After spying on him talking to [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Borin Duskrag\|Borin Duskrag]] and [[Notable NPC's/Allies/Shandra Loomens\|Shandra Loomens]] the crew decided to leave [[World/Korlornium/Caldirth/Duskwind Landing/Duskwind Landing\|Duskwind Landing]] and search for [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Zora Meadowlark\|Zora Meadowlark]]. [[Player Characters/Vel'Korr\|Vel'Korr]] also chatted with [[Notable NPC's/Baddies/Elandra Daenbright\|Elandra Daenbright]] who was on the hunt for a former comrade of the group, [[Player Characters/Ira\|Ira]]. She gave him a sending stone with leaves on it to give her a call if he found any more info about her whereabouts. She said she wanted to reunite her with her brother.
