[[Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]] are a unique species native to [[World/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], originating from the vast deserts of [[World/Korlornium/Siroth/Siroth\|Siroth]]. According to legend, they were forged from the sands of [[World/Korlornium/Siroth/Siroth\|Siroth]] by the goddess of life, [[Gods/Major Powers/Solwyn\|Solwyn]], in the heart of [[The Great Dune\|The Great Dune]] Region. These humanoid falcons possess razor-sharp intellect, keen eyesight, and an innate connection to the magics of earth and sky.

In ancient times, [[Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]] thrived as nomadic clans, soaring over dunes and navigating the shifting sands with an instinctual mastery of wind currents. They were deeply revered as seers and scholars, their wisdom sought by desert dwellers. However, during the persecution of magic users, many [[Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]] were hunted, driven from their ancestral lands, or slain. Some managed to flee deep into the Southern [[World/Korlornium/Siroth/Siroth\|Siroth]] Desert, vanishing into the endless sands, while others perished defending their right to wield magic.

Today, sightings of [[Species/Fowlmen\|Fowlmen]] are rare, and their surviving enclaves remain hidden. Those who still roam the world often do so in secret, wary of outsiders yet still carrying the ancient knowledge of their people.
