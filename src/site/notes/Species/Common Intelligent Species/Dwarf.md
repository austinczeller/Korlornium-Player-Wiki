# Dwarf
Dwarves are renowned for their skill in crafting, particularly with iron, stone, and other durable materials. They are expert blacksmiths, stoneworkers, and engineers, known for creating intricate designs and durable constructions that can withstand the test of time. Their societies are built on the principles of craftsmanship, tradition, and the pursuit of perfection in their works. Dwarves take great pride in their ability to shape the earth, transforming raw materials into masterpieces, whether that be in the form of finely wrought armor, majestic stone buildings, or complex mechanical devices.

Dwarves have a deep connection to the gods [[Gods/Major Powers/Ulthagos\|Ulthagos]], the god of the land and earth, and [[Gods/Major Powers/Forgas\|Forgas]], the god of fire and forge. 

Dwarves typically make their homes in elaborate caverns and caves, often located deep within the mountains or rolling hills. These subterranean dwellings are marvels of engineering, with stone halls and chambers intricately carved into the earth. Dwarven cities are renowned for their strength and beauty, often built to withstand earthquakes, avalanches, and the passage of time. Many of these cities have sprawling networks of tunnels and mines, where dwarves extract precious metals, gems, and stone, which they use in their crafts and trade.

Although dwarves are primarily associated with the mountains and hills, they are not confined to these places. Dwarves can be found throughout [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]], particularly in bustling trade cities or areas where their skills are in high demand. They often engage in commerce, trading their expertly crafted goods for other rare materials, and have earned a reputation for being shrewd and meticulous traders. Their knowledge of metalworking, stone carving, and mechanical engineering is highly sought after by other races and factions.

Dwarves live by a strict code of honor and tradition. They value loyalty, hard work, and respect for their ancestors and gods. Their society is often organized in clans, with each clan responsible for different aspects of dwarven life. Clan leaders are usually chosen based on merit and achievement in craftsmanship, battle, or leadership. Dwarven warriors are just as respected as their craftsmen, with many dwarves undergoing rigorous training in both combat and smithing to prove their worth.

Though dwarves are known for their stoic and serious demeanor, they also possess a strong sense of camaraderie and community. Their halls are filled with laughter, song, and the clinking of hammers and anvils as they work together to create the next masterpiece. Dwarven feasts are famous for their hearty food, fine mead, and the sharing of tales and songs passed down through generations.

Dwarves have a deep respect for the history and traditions of their people, and they maintain extensive records of their ancestors' deeds, the great works of craftsmanship, and the tales of their victories and struggles. These records are often stored in vast libraries or vaults deep within their cities, and are considered sacred by dwarven society.
