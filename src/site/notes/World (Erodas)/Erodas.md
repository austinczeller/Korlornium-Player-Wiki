# Erodas
[[World (Erodas)/Erodas\|Erodas]] is the earth-like planet which contains many continents such as [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]].

[[World (Erodas)/Erodas\|Erodas]] has two moons but *typically* only [[Têthra\|Têthra]] is visible at night. [[Pêpra\|Pêpra]], or the yellow moon is often concealed behind the large white moon of [[Têthra\|Têthra]].


The calendar year follows similarly to Earth's seasons however months are not distinguished from another. Erodians (people of [[World (Erodas)/Erodas\|Erodas]]) simply count the number of days they are within a season (typically 80). 

The [[World (Erodas)/Erodas\|Erodas]] calendar however is very region specific and many intellectuals are in the process of developing a more standardized method of telling the time which can be translated across continents. 

[[World (Erodas)/Erodas\|Erodas]] exists within the [[Planes/The Mundane World\|The Mundane World]].
