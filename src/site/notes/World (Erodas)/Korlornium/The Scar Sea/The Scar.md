# The Scar
The Scar or the Scar Sea is a shallow sea which separates the continent of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]]. It was formed during the events of [[History/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]]. It now separates the Eastern lands of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Siroth/Siroth\|Siroth]] from the western lands of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Caldirth/Caldrith\|Caldrith]].

The Scar is the vast, treacherous sea that now divides the western and eastern lands of [[World (Erodas)/Korlornium/Korlornium\|Korlornium]]. It was not always an ocean—before the [[History/The Great Wave\|The Great Wave]] it was fertile land, home to thriving civilizations. However, a catastrophic series of tsunamis and floods submerged the region, leaving only a scattering of islands amidst the waters. The cause of the flood remains a mystery, lost to time, though scholars and priests speculate that it was an act of divine punishment or the workings of ancient, forgotten magic.

The Scar is a lawless expanse riddled with piracy. Its many islands serve as hideouts for pirate gangs, who control much of the trade between the east and west. Passage across The Scar is dangerous, and most travelers must pay these pirate factions for safe passage. The [[Gods/Major Powers/Tidemother\|Tidemother]], goddess of the sea, is revered by sailors and pirates alike, for it is she who dictates the tempests and tides.
